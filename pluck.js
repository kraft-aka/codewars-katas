// Don't you just love Wikipedia lists?

// In this Kata, you'll write a function that extracts pieces of
// data and stores them in an Array.

// The function will accept two parameters:

// data An Array of Objects
// property A String representing the property from which to pluck data
// An Array should be returned, containing the value extracted for
// each Object contained in the data Array.

// See the Test Cases for examples.

const pluck = (data, property) => data.map((i) => i[property]);
