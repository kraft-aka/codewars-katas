// Story
// Peter lives on a hill, and he always moans about the way to his home. "It's always just up. I never get a rest". But you're pretty sure that at least at one point Peter's altitude doesn't rise, but fall. To get him, you use a nefarious plan: you attach an altimeter to his backpack and you read the data from his way back at the next day.

// Task
// You're given a list of compareable elements:

// heights = [h1, h2, h3, â€¦, hn]
// Your job is to check whether for any x all successors are greater or equal to x.

// isMonotone([1,2,3]) == true
// isMonotone([1,1,2]) == true
// isMonotone([1])     == true
// isMonotone([3,2,1]) == false
// isMonotone([3,2,2]) == false

var isMonotone = function (arr) {
  return arr.join("") === arr.sort((a, b) => a - b).join("");
};
