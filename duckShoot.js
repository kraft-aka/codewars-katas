// You've arrived at a carnival and head straight for the duck shooting tent. Why wouldn't you?

// You will be given a set amount of ammo, and an aim rating of between 1 and 0. No your aim is not always perfect - hey maybe someone fiddled with the sights on the gun...

// Anyway your task is to calculate how many successful shots you will be able to make given the available ammo and your aim score, then return a string representing the pool of ducks, with those ducks shot marked with 'X' and those that survived left unchanged. You will always shoot left to right.

// Example of start and end duck string with two successful shots:

// Start ---> |~~~~~22~2~~~~~|

// Bang!! Bang!!

// End ---> |~~~~~XX~2~~~~~|

// All inputs will be correct type and never empty.

function duckShoot(ammo, aim, ducks) {
  const shots = Math.floor(ammo * aim);
  let count = 0;
  const arr = ducks.split("");
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === "2") {
      arr[i] = "X";
      count++;
    }
    if (count === shots) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return arr.join("");
}
