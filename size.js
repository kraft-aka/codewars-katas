// Implement Array.prototype.size() - without .length !
// Implement Array.prototype.size(), which should simply return the length of the array. But do it entirely without using Array.prototype.length!
// Where .length is a property, .size() is a method.

// Rules
// Because it is quite impossible to disable [].length, and because filtering for "length" is an iffy proposition at best,
// THIS KATA WORKS ON THE HONOUR SYSTEM.
// You may cheat. But you may have trouble sleeping. Or $DEITY may kill a puppy.

// You need not support sparse arrays (but you may!). All testing will be done with dense arrays.
// Values will not be undefined. You need only support actual, real arrays.

// Your method needs to be read only. Arguments must be ignored. The this object must not be modified.

// Be creative!

Array.prototype.size = function () {
  let count = 0;
  this.forEach((i) => count++);
  return count;
};
