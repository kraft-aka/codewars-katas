// Task
// Heading off to the Tree Arboretum of Various Heights, I bring along my camera to snap
// up a few photos. Ideally, I'd want to take a picture of as many trees as possible, but
// the taller trees may cover up the shorter trees behind it.

// A tree is hidden if it is shorter than or the same height as a ( any ) tree in front of
// it, as seen in a particular direction.

// Given a list of tree heights, create a function which returns "left" or "right",
// depending on which side allows me to see as many trees as possible.

// Worked Example
// [1, 3, 1, 6, 5] âžž "left"
// // If I stand on the left, I can see trees of heights 1, 3 and 6.
// // If I stand on the right, I can see trees of heights 5 and 6.
// // Return "left" because I would see more trees.

function treePhotography(trees) {
  let left = [trees[0]],
    right = [trees[trees.length - 1]];

  for (let i = 0; i < trees.length - 1; i++) {
    if (left[left.length - 1] < trees[i]) {
      left.push(trees[i]);
    }
  }

  for (let i = trees.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (right[0] < trees[i] && trees[i] > trees[i + 1]) {
      if (trees[i] > trees[i + 1]) {
        right.unshift(trees[i]);
      }
    }
  }

  return left.length >= right.length ? "left" : "right";
}
